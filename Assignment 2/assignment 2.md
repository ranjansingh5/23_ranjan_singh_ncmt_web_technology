# Chapter-2 Web Development Process 
# Group A: Short Questions📌

---
# 1. Define the term “Sitemap” in the planning phase.❓
-> A Sitemap is a visual or structured list of all web pages that shows how pages are connected. It helps plan website structure and navigation before development begins.

# 2. What is the purpose of the “Launch” phase in web development? ❓
-> The Launch phase is when the website is deployed to a live server and made available to users. It ensures the site works correctly in a real environment.

# 3. Why is “Documentation” important in the development lifecycle? ❓
-> Documentation records system details, design, and functionality. It helps in maintenance, future updates, and understanding the project easily.

# 4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.❓
-> The difference between Front-end and Back-end development are given below:
Front-end Development	              |    Back-end Development
Deals with user interface and design  |   Deals with server-side logic
Focuses on what users see	          |    Focuses on data processing
Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript	          |   Uses PHP, Java, Python, Node.js
Runs in the browser	                  |    Runs on the server

# Group B: Long Questions 📌
# 5. “Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss by listing key activities.❓
-> Planning is considered the most critical phase because it defines the direction of the entire project. Mistakes made here can affect all later stages.

* Key activities during the planning phase include:

- Requirement analysis: Understanding what the client or users need from the website.
- Goal definition: Deciding the purpose of the website (information, sales, services, etc.).
- Target audience identification: Knowing who will use the website.
- Sitemap creation: Planning the structure and navigation of pages.
- Technology selection: Choosing tools, languages, and platforms.
- Timeline and resource planning: Estimating cost, time, and team roles.
- Proper planning reduces errors, saves time, and ensures smooth development.

# 6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly “finished”?❓
-> The Maintenance phase is iterative because it involves continuous updates and improvements even after the website is launched.

* Reasons why a website is never truly finished:
- User needs and expectations keep changing.
- Content needs regular updates (news, products, information).
- Bugs and technical issues may appear over time.
- Security updates and performance improvements are required.
- New technologies and design trends emerge.
Because these changes happen repeatedly, maintenance follows a cycle of monitoring, updating, testing, and improving.

# 7. Describe the process of Information Gathering. Why is understanding the target audience crucial?❓
-> Information Gathering is the process of collecting all necessary details before designing and developing a website.

* This process includes:
- Understanding project goals and objectives.
- Gathering client requirements and expectations.
- Analyzing competitors and similar websites.
- Identifying technical and content requirements.

* Understanding the target audience is crucial because:
- It helps design a user-friendly interface.
- Content can be tailored to user needs and preferences.
- Navigation and features become more effective.
- It improves user satisfaction and engagement.

# Group C: Scenario-Based Questions 📌
# 8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the “Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining the potential risks.❓
-> As a project manager, I would explain to the client that skipping the Testing phase can create serious risks that may harm the business in the long run.

First, there are security risks. Without proper testing, security loopholes such as weak login systems or insecure payment gateways may remain unnoticed. This can lead to customer data breaches and financial loss.
Second, functionality issues may occur. Important features like product search, cart, checkout, or payment confirmation may not work correctly, causing customers to abandon purchases.
Third, there are compatibility problems. The website may work on one browser or device but fail on others, leading to poor user experience for many customers.

In conclusion, testing ensures the website is secure, reliable, and works smoothly on all devices. Skipping this phase may save money initially but can cause bigger losses and damage to the brand after launch.

# 9. A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze what went wrong and how it should have been handled.❓
-> In this situation, the main problem was skipping the planning and design phases of web development.

The developer started coding without creating a sitemap or design prototype, so the website structure and layout were never clearly defined. As a result, the developer’s understanding did not match the client’s expectations, leading to rejection of the layout midway.

This situation should have been handled by first gathering detailed requirements from the client. A sitemap should have been created to plan the page structure, followed by wireframes or mockups to show the layout visually. After getting client approval, coding should have started.

Proper planning and design would have avoided rework, saved time, and ensured client satisfaction.

# 10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase.❓
-> The neglected phase in this case is the Maintenance phase.

Although the website was launched successfully, the exam schedules were not updated regularly. Because students could no longer find accurate information, they stopped visiting the site.

The Maintenance phase involves activities such as updating content, fixing bugs, improving security, checking performance, and ensuring information remains current. It also includes monitoring user feedback and making necessary improvements.

In simple terms, maintenance keeps a website useful and trustworthy. Without regular updates, even a well-designed website becomes outdated and loses its users.
